                    <Accordion.Body>
                        1. Using the setState method: The setState method can be used to update the state of a component, causing it to re-render.
                        <br />

                        2. Using the useState hook: The useState hook is a built-in hook in React that allows you to manage state in functional components.

                        <br />

                        3. Using the useReducer hook: The useReducer hook is similar to useState but is more powerful and can be used for more complex state management.

                        <br />

                        4. Using a state management library such as Redux: Redux is a popular library that allows you to manage the state of your entire application in a centralized location.

                        5. Using the Context API : The Context API is a built-in feature of React that allows you to share state between components without having to pass props down manually through the component tree.

                    <Accordion.Header>How does prototypical inheritance work?</Accordion.Header>
                    <Accordion.Body>
                        Prototypical inheritance is a way for objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. In JavaScript, all objects have a hidden property called prototype, which is a reference to another object. When a property or method is accessed on an object, the JavaScript engine first looks for that property or method on the object itself. If it is not found, the engine looks for it on the object's prototype, and so on, up the prototype chain.

                    <Accordion.Header>What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?</Accordion.Header>
                    <Accordion.Body>
                        A unit test is a type of software testing that tests individual units of source code, such as functions or methods, to determine if they are working as intended. Unit tests are typically automated and are written using a testing framework.

                        Unit tests are important because they help ensure that the individual components of a software system are working correctly, and that changes made to the codebase do not break existing functionality. By writing unit tests, developers can catch bugs early in the development process, which can save time and resources in the long run.

                        Unit tests also provide a way to test edge cases and different scenarios, and can be run multiple times to verify the validity of the code. This helps to increase the confidence of the developer on their code and also serves as an indication of code quality.

                        Additionally, unit tests serve as a form of documentation for the code, making it easier for other developers to understand how the code works and how it should be used.

                        React:
                        <br />

                        It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
                        <br />
                        React focuses on building reusable UI components and it uses a virtual DOM to optimize performance.
                        <br />
                        It is lightweight and flexible, making it easy to integrate with other libraries and tools.
                        <br />
                        Its popularity is due to its flexibility and ease of integration with other libraries and technologies.
                        
                        <br />
                        Angular:
                        <br />

                        It is a complete framework for building web applications.
                        Angular uses two-way data binding and a powerful template system to make building dynamic UIs simple.
                        <br />
                        It has a large and active community, and it is backed by Google.
                        <br />
                        Angular's architecture is opinionated, which means it enforces a specific way of building applications.
                        
                        <br />
                        Vue:
                        <br />
                        It is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
                        <br />
                        It combines the best features of React and Angular, and it is very easy to learn.
                        <br />
                        Vue uses a virtual DOM and a template system similar to Angular.
                        <br />
                        It is lightweight and flexible and it offers a lot of flexibility in the way you structure your application.
